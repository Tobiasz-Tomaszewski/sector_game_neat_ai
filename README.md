NEAT Algorithm Educational Project
----------------------------------

Welcome to our educational project utilizing the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to train an AI
to play a simple game.

### Game Details

The game we are teaching the AI to play has been previously developed and is accessible in the following repository:
https://github.com/Tobiasz-Tomaszewski/sector_game. In that repository, you can find a more user-friendly version of the
game, along with documentation.

### Project Inspiration

This project is built upon a tutorial, which serves as our guiding resource. For a detailed walkthrough and insights,
refer to the tutorial available in the bibliography: https://youtu.be/2f6TmKm7yx0?si=3BF1LsS0vNNr3c5g.
